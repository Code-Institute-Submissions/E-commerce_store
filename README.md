# Ecommerce Store

The goal of this site is to allow individual users to sign in to shop and sell items

Users of this site will be able to register from the homepage. Once registered they can sign in and view items for sale which will be saved via a postgresql database.
The site is targeting towards all people who are looking to make us of a unique and comprehensive store.



## Features:


### General Navigation:

I Designed the site with UX in mind.

Users are initially directed to a login page where they can sign in using a username and password or use a register redirect to sign up for the store.

New users will be directed to a register page where there will be three fields for them to fill out, Username, password and password confirmation. 

Users that have either logged in or registered will be directed to the home page. Here they will have a multitude of options to purchase or sell.

Returning users can delete or update already created store items.

The site has been styled using CSS in a main.html file which in pulled from in all other template files. 


### The Home Page:

The home page is the first page shown to a user.

It shows the user items for sale. 

The user can see prices, images of the products and is available to add to cart.

A screenshot of the view for this page is shown below. This view is called on within the urls.py file and is tested on in the test.py file. 

The user can login and out.

They can access there cart. 

The cart has a icon above it showing the amount in it.

### Unfixed Bugs

Failure to deploy project in time. 

## Deployment

I unfortunately was unable to deploy the site successfully

The orginal livelink was here https://ecommerce.herokuapp.com/

I understand this is unacceptable for a pass and essentially misses out on all passable criteria. I wish to resubmit a completed version of this site fully deployed.
